---------
connect error enumeration:
1. 111==ECONNREFUSED
if connect() to a non existing port, tcpdum shows peer return RST and 'Connection refused' is got locally at once:
$ ./rewrite-nc.out 127.0.0.1 9999
connect() ok?
**111 4B:rewrite-nc.out: connect to 127.0.0.1:9999 (tcp) err 1: Connection refused
rewrite-nc.out: connect error: Connection refused


2. 113==EHOSTUNREACH(no route to host):
Frist let's see normal setup sequence on vm1 and vm2:
vm1@192.168.193.129(NAT)
$ sudo tunctl -t tap0 -u rednoah
Set 'tap0' persistent and owned by uid 1000
$ sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1
$ sudo ./relay.out -i tap0 -c 192.168.1.147
vm2@192.168.1.147(BRIDGED):
$sudo tunctl -u rednoah -t tap0
$sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.2
$sudo ./relay.out -i tap0 -s <==then ssh 10.0.0.1 at vm2 or ssh 10.0.0.2 at vm1 can work at the same time.

a.IF BOTH SIDE DON'T START relay.out:
run the following on vm1
$ ./rewrite-nc.out 10.0.0.2 22
connect() ok?
**113 4B:rewrite-nc.out: connect to 10.0.0.2:22 (tcp) err 1: No route to host
rewrite-nc.out: connect error: No route to host

and tcpdump
$ sudo tcpdump  -nn -i tap0 -i lo<--if only -i tap0, no any output. But if use -i lo only, there is tap0's ip packets flow also! Strange!
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on lo, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
13:51:36.302309 IP 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP host 10.0.0.2 unreachable, length 68

b.if vm1's relay.out is not launched but vm2's replay.out is launched. There is
'No route to host' still as the packet can't arrive 10.0.0.2 at last.

3. ETIMEDOUT(time out)
If the normal sequnce of 2 is partly finished: Neither run reply.out, ie no packet from vm1 will be relayed
to vm2:make vm1 connect() a non existing ip and port:
$ sudo arp -s 10.0.0.2 12:34:56:78:9a:bc<--to avoid 'No route to host' error
$ arp -an
...
? (10.0.0.2) at 12:34:56:78:9a:bc [ether] PERM on tap0<--the manually added entry for 10.0.0.2 works

NOTE the following rewrite-nc.out's select()'s timeout is NULL ie select() will AL wait. And the socket connect() uses
has been set to O_NONBLOCK. Even so connect() still has a timeout of 120s.
$ date;./rewrite-nc.out 10.0.0.2 9999;date
Tue May  4 15:59:19 CST 2021<--the 1st of 2 to display

//<--manually added blank line from keyboard input
connect() ok?<--this line and its following is the 2nd of 2 to display.
**110 4B:rewrite-nc.out: connect to 10.0.0.2:9999 (tcp) err 1: Connection timed out
rewrite-nc.out: connect error: Connection timed out
Tue May  4 16:01:28 CST 2021<--the delta time is about 120s

try using nc to test in the same condition:
$ date;nc 10.0.0.2 9999;date
Tue May  4 16:11:25 CST 2021


Tue May  4 16:13:35 CST 2021

4. Once normal sequence of 2 has been setup, the 3's connect error will become 'Connection refused' as 10.0.0.2 has no such port opened.
tap0 device can has >=2 ips besides 10.0.0.2, eg the other is a qemu of 10.0.0.3. So the tap0 will not send RST for unknown ip?
